# GameBot

Python Bot using Discord API (discordpy) to implement board games via channels.

### Scope
This is a work in progress. This is a Discord bot in the works that would in the 
future support games such as Secret Hitler, One Night Ultimate Werewolf and other 
board games. Currently, we're working on implementing One Night Ultimate Werewolf.
Most of the commands and various inputs/decisions that players would have to make are 
processed via direct messages with this bot, or reacting to messages!
If you'd like to see the work we've done so far, feel free to check out the other
branches in this repo! (namely the FactionRoles branch)
